Version for Ubuntu 16.04
-- TurnkeyLinux suggest you run on Ubuntu by using a wget commmand, but Ubuntu 16.04 is based on "stretch" and not "jessie" 
   their command fails.
   This reposiitory includes a modified verion of their install script renamed "ez-apt-install-ubuntu.sh", which 
   fixes this problem by hard-coding in a reference to "stretch" and subsituting "jessie". It also contains some comments as
   I work out what this script does!
